\section{T4 Introduction}
The role of the T4 system in the project is to handle information processing and learning tasks for the system.

This system will be divided into an overhead component and several additional units which will handle different tasks.

The overhead unit will be the means by which the rest interface uses the rest of the T4 system.

\section{T4 Processing}
A question of this system is how to handle the issues of data processing. The full amount of potential processed data of the system will continue to grow as capabilities are expanded. A plan for the approach of handling this could be an incremental approach where the difference between the potential processing outcome and current state of processing is closed. 

For now the system will pursue an approach enabling assignment of processing goals and monitoring of their status.

The breakdown of tasks. Currently the only data processing tasks are the processing the text body objects into Ls, NERS, and Noun chunks.

The assignent task are then broken down into individual units of vecs, lists of vecs, ctions, and the full dataset (maybe just over a single company).
